I am currently a data scientist/general software person working in Cambridge, MA.  I am in the process of starting a company, [Equirio](http://www.equirio.com).  In the past, I have worked as a diplomat, a consultant, and an operations manager.  You can find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/vikparuchuri), or email me at vik dot paruchuri at gmail dot com.  Look forward to hearing from you!
