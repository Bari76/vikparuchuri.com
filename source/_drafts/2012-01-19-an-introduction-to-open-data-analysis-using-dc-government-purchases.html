I decided to see what information could be discovered using open data sets.  <a href="http://opendata.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> is a good starting point, and I quickly found a data set that listed all purchases made on DC government credit cards from January 2009 to April 2009.  Further investigation led to a more comprehensive data set located <a href="http://ocp.dc.gov/DC/OCP/e-Library/What+We+Buy/What+We+Buy-Purchase+Card+Transactions">here</a>, which contains data through June of 2010.</div>
